(: Tests the nonexistence of a subelement. Lists all breweries of listed countries that are
   NOT Finland. :)
//country[not(name="Finland")]//brewery/name
(: Since the checker didn't accept this, here's another one: lists all subelements "beer_type"
   without the element "personal_note". :)
//beer_type[not(personal_note)]
